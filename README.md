# YinYang K-Means Python Implementation


## About Application
> A python implementation of Yinyang K-means, another algorithm for K-means cluster calculation. By clustering the focuses in the underlying stage, and utilizing productively kept up lower and upper limits between a point and focuses, it more adequately maintains a strategic distance from superfluous separation computations than earlier calculations. It altogether outranks earlier K-means calculations reliably over all tested information sets, group numbers, and machine setups. The predictable, unrivaled execution—in addition to its effortlessness, client control of overheads, and certification in delivering an indistinguishable cluster comes about because of the standard K-means—makes Yinyang K-means a drop-in replacement of the classic K-means with a request of greatness higher execution.
